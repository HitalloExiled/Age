/// <remarks>Note: Device coherence is a useful property for certain debugging use cases (e.g. crash analysis, where performing separate coherence actions could mean values are not reported correctly). However, device coherent accesses may be slower than equivalent accesses without device coherence, particularly if they are also device uncached. For device uncached memory in particular, repeated accesses to the same or neighbouring memory locations over a short time period (e.g. within a frame) may be slower than it would be for the equivalent cached memory type. As such, it is generally inadvisable to use device coherent or device uncached memory except when really needed.</remarks>
