/// <summary>
/// Vulkan command return codes.</para>
/// <para>While the core Vulkan API is not designed to capture incorrect usage, some circumstances still require return codes. Commands in Vulkan return their status via return codes that are in one of two categories:</para>
/// <list type="bullet">
/// <item>Successful completion codes are returned when a command needs to communicate success or status information. All successful completion codes are non-negative values.</item>
/// <item>Run time error codes are returned when a command needs to communicate a failure that could only be detected at runtime. All runtime error codes are negative values.</item>
/// </list>
/// <para>If a command returns a runtime error, unless otherwise specified any output parameters will have undefined contents, except that if the output parameter is a structure with sType and pNext fields, those fields will be unmodified. Any structures chained from pNext will also have undefined contents, except that sType and pNext will be unmodified.</para>
/// <para>VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_*_MEMORY errors do not modify any currently existing Vulkan objects. Objects that have already been successfully created can still be used by the application.</para>
/// <remarks>As a general rule, Free, Release, and Reset commands do not return <see cref="VK_ERROR_OUT_OF_HOST_MEMORY"/>, while any other command with a return code may return it. Any exceptions from this rule are described for those commands.</remarks>
/// <para><see cref="VK_ERROR_UNKNOWN"/> will be returned by an implementation when an unexpected error occurs that cannot be attributed to valid behavior of the application and implementation. Under these conditions, it may be returned from any command returning a VkResult.</para>
/// <remarks><see cref="VK_ERROR_UNKNOWN"/> is not expected to ever be returned if the application behavior is valid, and if the implementation is bug-free. If <see cref="VK_ERROR_UNKNOWN"/> is received, the application should be checked against the latest validation layers to verify correct behavior as much as possible. If no issues are identified it could be an implementation issue, and the implementor should be contacted for support.</remarks>
/// <para>Any command returning a VkResult may return <see cref="VK_ERROR_VALIDATION_FAILED_EXT"/> if a violation of valid usage is detected, even though commands do not explicitly list this as a possible return code.</para>
/// <para>Performance-critical commands generally do not have return codes. If a runtime error occurs in such commands, the implementation will defer reporting the error until a specified point. For commands that record into command buffers (vkCmd*) runtime errors are reported by vkEndCommandBuffer.</para>
