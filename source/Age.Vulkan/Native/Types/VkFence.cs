/// <summary>
/// Fences are a synchronization primitive that can be used to insert a dependency from a queue to the host. Fences have two states - signaled and unsignaled. A fence can be signaled as part of the execution of a <see href="https://registry.khronos.org/vulkan/specs/1.3-extensions/html/vkspec.html#devsandqueues-submission">queue submission</see> command. Fences can be unsignaled on the host with <see cref="Vk.ResetFences"/>. Fences can be waited on by the host with the <see cref="Vk.WaitForFences"/> command, and the current state can be queried with <see cref="Vk.GetFenceStatus"/>.
/// The internal data of a fence may include a reference to any resources and pending work associated with signal or unsignal operations performed on that fence object, collectively referred to as the fenceâ€™s payload. Mechanisms to import and export that internal data to and from fences are provided below. These mechanisms indirectly enable applications to share fence state between two or more fences and other synchronization primitives across process and API boundaries.
