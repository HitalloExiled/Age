/// <para>Structure specifying parameters of a newly created framebuffer</para>
/// <para>It is legal for a subpass to use no color or depth/stencil attachments, either because it has no attachment references or because all of them are <see cref="VK_ATTACHMENT_UNUSED"/>. This kind of subpass can use shader side effects such as image stores and atomics to produce an output. In this case, the subpass continues to use the width, height, and layers of the framebuffer to define the dimensions of the rendering area, and the rasterizationSamples from each pipelineâ€™s <see cref="VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo"/> to define the number of samples used in rasterization; however, if <see cref="VkPhysicalDeviceFeatures.variableMultisampleRate"/> is VK_FALSE, then all pipelines to be bound with the subpass must have the same value for <see cref="VkPipelineMultisampleStateCreateInfo.rasterizationSamples"/>. In all such cases, rasterizationSamples must be a bit value that is set in <see cref="VkPhysicalDeviceLimits.framebufferNoAttachmentsSampleCounts"/>.</para>
